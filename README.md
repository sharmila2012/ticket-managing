# TicketManaging

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Ticketing managing application

Build a ticket managing app, where the user can add, filter, assign, and complete tickets.

- The app should have three screens: the list screen, the details screen and add/update screen.
- While updating, need to change description, assignee, completed
- Please use the Angular router to manage the transitions between them.
- Use URL path parameters or query parameters for handling id between pages.
- We are using bootstrap for styling, you can either use it or use any better solution.
- Even though we tend to use NgRx for state management, you can use a different approach if you think it fits better.
- Don't forget about error handling and race conditions. The API server has a random delay. If you bump it up to say 10 seconds, would the app still work correctly? Set a loader for waiting.
